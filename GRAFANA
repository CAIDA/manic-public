We are providing an interactive web interface to view the TSLP
data. The system is based on Grafana.

The publicly accessible view on Grafana provides two dashboards:

1) "All links from VP network to neighbor network": This dashboard
allows the user to select the VP network (network hosting our
measurement vantage points), and a neighbor network ASN, and displays
latencies from each VP in the selected VP network to each interdomain
link with the neighbor network. We display the "far sides" of each
observed interdomain link to minimize clutter on the graph. By default
the graph shows the last 7 days. It is possible to zoom in to specific
time ranges of interest using the selection menus at the top.

2) "Individual links from VP network to neighbor network": This
dashboard allows the user to select the VP network (network hosting
our measurement vantage points), a specific monitor within the
network, a neighbor network ASN, and the specific interdomain link as
represented by the far-side IP address. The plot then displays the
latency from the selected monitor towards both sides of the
interdomain link. By default the graph shows the last 7 days. It is
possible to zoom in to specific time ranges of interest using the
selection menus at the top.
